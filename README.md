# wind-nmea-sim-esp32
Small simulator that generates some wind NMEA0183 sentences on an ESP32 and announces it's service via MDNS.
Intended to be a test vehicle to emulate a WindSensor (https://gitlab.com/norbertwalter67/Windsensor_WiFi_1000) especially for the interworking with 
AvNav (https://www.wellenvogel.net/software/avnav/docs/beschreibung.html?lang=en).
